This Python program can generate and read QR Code. For some reason it is not able to extract the data from the QR Code image, if the data is too long. Is it a limitation of the module?. I don't know. I have not been able to figure this out. Other than this it works perfectly.

Run this command in the command line to install the necessary packages:
> pip install opencv-python, pyqrcode
